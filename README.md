  <b>React JS</b>
  <blockquote>
    React will let developers make large scale web applications that can render data, without the need to manually reload the   page. This is an event driven architecture which is different from MVC and will let the data display dependent on the event that is fired on the page. React is simple, fast and scalable and allows the use of reusable UI components.
